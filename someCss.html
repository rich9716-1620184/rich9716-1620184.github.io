        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="font-family:serif;">
           Greetings everyone! My name is Richard Lim and I'm a senior at the University of Washington pursing a B.A. in Marketing. 
           I'm very excited to learn HTML through INFO 101 with Professor Bob. 
           Even though all the classes are online, I'm trying to make the best out of my last quarter at the university. 
           I think staying positive during this time is very important and therefore we should help each other to get through this challening time.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family:fantasy;">
           My hobbies are listeing to music, socializing with friends, and being active outside. 
           This pandemic is not allowing me to be outside so I'm currently looking for new hobbies. 
           I think learning HTML is defintely my new hobby now because it's keeping me productive and entertained. 
        </p>
